# Minecraft Manhunt (Bedrock)
**https://mcpedl.com/minecraft-manhunt/ - Add-on link**

Latest Add-On Version: **1.7.1.16**

# Announcement
hi, i've decided that i will stop developing this manhunt addon.

It's been over a year since the add-on first release and the trend starts fading away.

I have other interest eg [animations](https://youtube.com/jaylymc) and [terminator addon](https://github.com/Jaylydev/terminator). It's time to move on. 

It was fun to develop this and actually got 50,000 people to download this.

Pull requests are still being reviewed and merged by me, if anyone wanna contribute this.

## Description
You activate the Add-on on a brand new world. There is one Speedrunner and one Hunter (or more). You should play this game in complete **survival vanilla Minecraft**. 

**The Speedrunner's goal** is to beat Minecraft, if they beat Minecraft or before the timer ends which you haven't got killed by hunter(s), the speedrunner wins. If the speedrunner died, they lose instantly.

**The Hunter's goal** is to kill the speedrunner by the end of beating Minecraft or the timer ends. Hunter(s) has/have a compass which can track the speedrunner. Remember the compass works only in the overworld dimension, or last location if the speedrunner is in the Nether. Also a reminder, hunter has unlimited life, each time they died they will receive a compass once they respawn.
